    question: "What is Medical Imaging Intelligence (MII)?",
    answer: "Medical Imaging Intelligence (MII) uses AI algorithms to analyze medical images like X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans, assisting in accurate diagnostics and early disease detection."
  },
  {
    question: "How does AI improve diagnostic accuracy in medical imaging?",
    answer: "AI models can identify subtle patterns and anomalies in medical images that might be overlooked by the human eye, reducing errors and improving diagnostic confidence."
  },
  {
    question: "Can AI detect diseases at an early stage?",
    answer: "Yes, AI algorithms are trained to recognize early signs of diseases like cancer, allowing for timely intervention and better patient outcomes."
  },
  {
    question: "Is patient data secure when using AI for medical imaging?",
    answer: "Absolutely. AI solutions comply with data protection standards like HIPAA and GDPR, ensuring secure storage, encryption, and transfer of medical images."
  },
  {
    question: "How quickly can AI be integrated into existing medical imaging systems?",
    answer: "Integration timelines vary, but AI models can be incorporated into hospital systems within 2-6 months, depending on the complexity of the infrastructure."
